category: oscillator
blurb: |
  `sinDamped(frequency, timeconstant, phase)` Returns a function whose input is a time (in seconds) and whose output is a point on a damped sine wave. You can create a 440 Hz damped sine wave with a time constant of 100 ms using `time.map(sinDamped(440, 0.1))`

  - `frequency` Frequency of the square wave in Hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.
  - `timeconstant` Time constant of the damped sine wave, in seconds. This is the time it takes to shrink to 37% (i.e. 1/e) of its size. Smaller = faster decay, larger = slower decay.
  - `phase (optional)` Phase shifts the wave to the left or right. A phase of PI shifts the wave a half-cycle to the right. `phase` can either be a number or it can be a wave, as used in Frequency Modulation.
