blurb: |
  `div` is a function associated with the `Wave` class that lets you divide a wave by a number, or divide a wave by another wave.

  `wave.div(10)` creates a new wave whose entries are those of the first wave divided by 10. You can use this at the end of loop to scale down the amplitude (gain) of the output wave, so that it isn't too loud.

let wave;

function setup() {
}

function loop() {
  wave = time.map(sin(440));

  return wave.div(10);
}
