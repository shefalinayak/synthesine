title: Wave
category: object
blurb: |
  `Wave(size)` is a class that creates the wave objects that store sounds in synthesine. A wave is an array of 32 bit floating point numbers, along with some prebuilt functions to manipulate waves.

  - `size (optional)` This sets the size of the array. Typically we leave this empty. If unspecified, the length of a wave is set to `numSamples`, which is 128 by default.

  `Wave` is an extension of javascript's built-in `Float32Array`, so it inherits all the [Float32Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array).

  ##### Usage

  - `new Wave()` creates an empty wave.
  - `new Wave().fill(0.1)` creates a wave filled with the value 0.1
  - `new Wave().map((e,i) => i/128)` creates a wave with 128 equally spaced values from 0 to 1

  ##### Wave Manipulation Functions

  - `.add` adds two waves together
  - `.sub` subtracts one wave from another
  - `.mult` multiples two waves or multiplies a wave with a number
  - `.div` divides two waves or divides a wave with a number
  - `.modulate` modulates one wave with another wave

  myWave = new Wave();

function loop() {
  return myWave;
