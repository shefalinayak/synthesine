title: phasor
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  `phasor(frequency, phase)` Returns a function whose input is a time (in seconds) and whose output is a point on a phasor wave. You can create a 440 Hz phasor wave by mapping a time wave to this phasor function, using `time.map(phasor(440))`

  - `frequency` Frequency of the square wave in Hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.
  - `phase (optional)` Phase shifts the wave to the left or right. A phase of PI shifts the wave a half-cycle to the right. `phase` can either be a number or it can be a wave, as used in Frequency Modulation.
