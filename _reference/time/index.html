blurb: |
  `time` is a wave of length `numSamples` (128 by default) that stores the current time values, in seconds. `time` is updated on every frame of the loop() function.

  Think of `time` as the basic clock in synthesine. You can create sounds by mapping `time` to other functions, such as any of the oscillators.

function setup() {
  // open the console to see what the time wave looks like
  console.log(time);
}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(sin(440))
    .mult(0.1);
}
