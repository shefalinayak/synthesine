blurb: |
  `sampleRate` stores the audio sample rate, or sampling frequency, which is [44100 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz).

  The Nyquist theorem states that the highest frequency that can be represented by a sampling rate of f is f/2. `sampleRate/2` is also referred to as the Nyquist Frequency, and in our case is above the high end of the human hearing range.

}
