blurb: |
  `saw(frequency, phase)` Returns a function whose input is a time (in seconds) and whose output is a point on a sawtooth wave (or saw wave for short). You can create a 440 Hz sawtooth wave by mapping a time wave to this saw function, using `time.map(saw(440))`

  - `frequency` Frequency of the saw wave in Hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.
  - `phase (optional)` Phase shifts the wave to the left or right. A phase of PI shifts the wave a half-cycle to the right. `phase` can either be a number or it can be a wave.
