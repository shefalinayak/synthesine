title: WaveTable
category: object
blurb: |
  `WaveTable(size)` is a class that creates a wave table object. A wave table is implemented in synthesine as a [circular buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer). This is a type of array where we can shift the point at which we start reading from, and where the end is followed by the start. Wave tables such as these are used in simulating musical instruments.

  - `size (optional)` This sets the size of the array, and can be any positive integer.

  `WaveTable` is an extension of `Wave`, which is itself an extension of javascript's built-in `Float32Array`, so it inherits all the [Float32Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array).

  ##### Usage

  - `new WaveTable(size);` creates an empty wave table.
  - `new WaveTable().fill(0.1)` creates a wave table filled with the value 0.1
  - `new WaveTable(100).map((e,i) => i/100)` creates a wave table filled with 100 equally spaced values from 0 to 1

  ##### Wave Table Manipulation Functions
  - `.delay(n)` shifts the current position of the wave table by `n` samples, and returns the wave table. To shift the wave table by a full audio cycle, use n = 128 (i.e. `numSamples`)
  - `.set(array)` sets the next 128 values of the wave table to the entries of `array`. The wave table is rewritten in a circular fashion, starting from the current position.
  - `.get()` returns the next 128 values of the wave table, starting from the current position.


  ##### Wave Manipulation Functions

  - `.add` adds two waves together
  - `.sub` subtracts one wave from another
  - `.mult` multiples two waves or multiplies a wave with a number
  - `.div` divides two waves or divides a wave with a number
  - `.modulate` modulates one wave with another wave
  - `.map` applies any function onto the wave entries

let wave;

function setup() {
  wave = new WaveTable(500).map((e,i) => i/500);
}

function loop() {
  wave.delay(128);
  return wave.get().mult(0.1);
}
